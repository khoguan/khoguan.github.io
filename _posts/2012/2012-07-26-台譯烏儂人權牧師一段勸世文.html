<p>Martin Luther King, Jr 牧師捌講："Anybody can serve. You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love."</p>
<p>台語翻譯：儂儂攏通[thang]服務社會。毋免有大學文憑才通服務，毋免會曉主詞動詞一致才通服務。咱只要有一粒憐憫[l&icirc;n/li&acirc;n-b&iacute;n]滿滿个心，一个對愛產生个靈魂。</p>
